# RetroarchBoxart

Made a Powershell Script to automatically check your playlist against what thumbnails you have
The Directory names need to be the same to work.
For example:
    The regular NES thumbnails are stored in a file, and a directory with the name: Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System
    The thumbnails would then be stored in retroarch as
    retroarch/thumbnails/Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System/Named_Boxarts
Thumbnails can be found at:
http://thumbnailpacks.libretro.com/

This was a simple script for me to use.  I probably will not update this.
